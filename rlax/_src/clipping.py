"""JAX functions for implementing forms of gradient clipping.

Gradient clipping is commonly used to avoid taking too large steps in parameter
space when updating the parameters of an agent's policy, value or model. Certain
forms of gradient clipping can be conveniently expressed as transformations of
the loss function optimized by a suitable gradient descent algorithm.
